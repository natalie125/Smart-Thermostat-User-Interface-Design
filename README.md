The interface is crafted to allow both scheduled and immediate temperature adjustments, striking a balance between usability and functionality.

The design aims to enhance user-friendliness by employing buttons and sliders rather than direct numeric input, minimising the risk of error and supporting more intuitive control. Key principles from Norman's Interaction Design are applied, focusing on visibility, feedback, and consistency to create a seamless experience. By simplifying input methods and prioritising accessibility, this interface aims to accommodate users with varying levels of technical expertise.
